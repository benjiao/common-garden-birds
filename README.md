A zine featuring common garden birds in the Philippines by [@benjiaonature](https://instagram.com/benjiaonature). I made this zine using photos I've taken while birdwatching. This was created as a giveaway for our wedding.

You can use my project as template on [Canva](https://tinyurl.com/ibonsahardin) our you can download the PDF or PNGs.

This is the layout that I used to print it on a single A4 size sheet of paper and assemble it without the need for binding. You can follow [this guide](https://www.42ndstreet.org.uk/support/read/how-to-make-your-own-zine/) to learn more about how to put it together.
